# SNR.py

SNR is the Signature Near-Ring, a construction based on the INVERT transform. You can read an in-depth explanation of
the signature function and SNR 
[here](https://complexor.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/recursive-signatures-and-the-signature-left-near-ring.pdf).

## Identities

This folder is where implementations of all my important identities reside.

* `snr_column` showcases the identity in Equation 62 of my SNR paper
* `snr_diagonal` showcases the identity in Equation 63
* `snr_triangles` showcases a variety of triangles with interesting signatures as per 5.1

## Archive

This contains miscellaneous math-ey code bits I've tested out over time.
